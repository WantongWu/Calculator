I learned a lot about ArrayDeque and how stack and queue are implemented through this class. One detail in using ArrayDeque<Object> is to use wrapper class to deliver the primitive types like double and char. And when it is considered an instance of Object class rather than specific Double or Character class, I need to convert them to the these specific class with an additional step. 

The most challenging part of this assignment is definitely Shunting-yard algorithm. It took me a long time to understand the algorithm, and the implementation is also not easy. The main things that make the algorithm hard to understand are the precedence of different operators and the right- and left-associativity. While implementing the algorithm, it is also hard to keep track of everything in a single While-loop. I messed up the break and continue keywords multiple times. The Shunting-yard algorithm makes me too exhausted to try kudos challenge. But overall I learned a lot, not only about the algorithm, but also the importance of postfix format expressions in computer science and math.
